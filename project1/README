Makefile Command:
0: make: build project
1: make build : build project
2: make new : new project, create src, bin, res dirs
3: make clean: clear classes generated
4: make rebuild" rebuild project
5: make jar: package your project into a executable jar

Directories Description:
bin/ : *.class files
src/ : *.java files
res/ : resource files such as KeyStore

Flow Chart:
./client  --|
            |
           / \ with SSL? 
          /   \_ Yes ___ ClientWithSSL.java
          \   /
           \ /
            | NO
         --------
        |        | _ ClientWithoutSSL.java
         --------
            |
         
Challenges I faced:
 1: since the SSL server is not certified, it takes me a long time to get server's certificate and put it in to my local trusted keystore
 2: Handle the incorrect string received from client user and server
 3: It's my first time to write Makefile, so I spend several days to learn the grmmar
Test my code:
 Just run client with different arguments of which there could be some argumets incorrec and test if the client could handle these Exceptions correctly.
